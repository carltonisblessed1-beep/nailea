              I hope you receive them with love,<br>
              because I carefully thought each one through.

              oh — and in case you’re wondering how I made this…<br>
              <strong>I coded the whole thing.</strong>

            <p>
              how long did it take?<br>
              two full days (yes I timed it… 49 hours to be exact).
